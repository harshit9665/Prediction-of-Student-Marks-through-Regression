# Prediction-of-Student-Marks-through-Regression

Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn
In this notebook we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

We will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
